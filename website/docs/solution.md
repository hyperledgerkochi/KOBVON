# Solution

We can do this with the help of tools and libraries of Hyperledger Aries, and thus, we can develop independent digital identifiers rooted on block chain. We use an approach called the verifiable credential model and these are Cryptographically protected data which is used to prove who we are. We also use self-sovereign identity and decentralized identifiers which are independent of the central authorities. Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a promising approach to decentralized handling of personal data that gives users back control of their data where it belongs. SSI further enables a higher level of trust on the internet by providing mechanisms that enable verifiable identification of parties to translation, reducing the need for a high-cost, in-person mechanism to establish trust.

In this system, we have:

* The government services that organizations access to apply for a variety of credentials, including registrations, permits and licenses. The services use instances of KOBVON issuer/verifier agents to verify claims and issue credentials.
* The KOB is a repository of public credentials issued by those services to KOB. Credentials are equivalent to the “Permit to Operate” documents posted on businesses’ walls.
* The identity registry underlies the system to infuse trust. The identity register is a decentralized, self-sovereign identity network built on blockchain/distributed ledger technology.

As an organization goes through the online application processes to acquire registrations, licenses or permits, the services get proofs from verifiable credentials already stored in KOB about the organization. Once a service completes the approval process and decides to issue the organization a registration, license or permit, they issue that public verifiable credential digitally to KOB about the organization.
